   \textbf{Comparison of reconstruction accuracies from column- and surface-based annotations.}
   \footnotesize
    Color coding represents non-parametric difference between accuracy measures, with red indicating superior surface performance and blue indicating superior column performance.
    The left column shows tilted retention policies and the right column shows steady retention policies.
    For heatmap charts, +'s indicate small, medium, and large effect sizes of the Cliff's delta statistic and *'s indicate statistical significance at $\alpha = 0.05$ via a Mann-Whitney U test.
